# NFL-NGS-Analysis
This is a full data analysis of the NFL Next Gen Dataset. In this project I tried to envision a future where NFL Scouts use Data to figure out the best possible pick. I measured the success of NFL recievers by different advanced statistics and physical statistics to find out if it is possible to predict a future NFL star before they are drafted.
